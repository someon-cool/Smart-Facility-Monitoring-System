fixture_health.py — Predictive Fixture Health scoring model for Smart Facility Monitor.

Implements Section 1 of the Track 2 Feature Implementation Plan:
- Transparent 6-factor weighted risk formula (Section 1.3)
- Health score: 100 - risk
- Status labels: Healthy, Watch, Degrading, High Risk
- Trend analysis: Deteriorating, Stable, Improving (Section 1.4)
- Deterministic, rule-based maintenance recommendations (Section 1.7 & Section 9 Rule 11)
- SQLite database persistence in `fixture_health` table (Section 1.5)
